    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>That’s everything Flex is capable of. But… let’s go over each diagram individually with comments. By the end of this
    Flex tutorial you should be up to speed with pretty much the complete picture of what it can do.</p>

    <h2>Flex</h2>
    <p>Flex is a set of rules for automatically stretching multiple columns and rows
    of content across parent container.</p>

        <h2>display:flex</h2>
        <p>Unlike many other CSS properties, in Flex you have a main container and
        items nested within it. Some CSS flex properties are used only on the parent. Others only on the items.</p>

<h1>Main-axis and Cross-axis</h1>
<p>While the list of items is provided in a linear way, Flex requires you to be
mindful of rows and columns. For this reason, it has two coordinate axis. The
horizontal axis is referred to as Main-Axis and the vertical is the Cross-Axis</p>
